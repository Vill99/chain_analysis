# chain_analysis
A simple script for analyzing everquest complete heal chains from logfiles.

To use this tool, it's expected you issue some commands in guildchat.

!startchain - This tells clerics to start their chain, but more importantly, it 
tells the script to start looking for complete heal log lines to analyze.

!chainspeed X - Where X is a digit. Currently only works with single digits, if 
you need a 10 second chain, maybe fix the code.

!stopchain - This tells the script to stop looking for log lines.
